# DanfoAI 🚌 — Conversational Nigerian Transit Agent on 0G

**Ask for any Lagos route, in your own language. Powered by 0G decentralized AI.**

DanfoAI is a voice-and-text agent that helps Lagos residents navigate *danfo*
(yellow minibuses) and BRT routes using natural language in **Yoruba, Igbo,
Hausa, Nigerian Pidgin, and English**. No maps, no menus — just talk.

> _"Mo fẹ lọ si Oshodi lati CMS"_ → DanfoAI replies in Yoruba with the best
> danfo route, where to change, and a fare estimate.

Built for the **0G Zero Cup**.

## Why this needs 0G (all three layers do real work)

DanfoAI breaks without any one of 0G's layers — it is not a bolt-on:

| Layer | What it does in DanfoAI | Why it matters |
|-------|------------------------|----------------|
| **0G Compute** | Runs the multilingual LLM inference on decentralized GPUs. Every reply is verified via `processResponse()` (TEE-backed). | Answers are **verifiable & censorship-resistant** — a centralized API can't prove its output wasn't altered. |
| **0G Storage** | Holds the route knowledge base, content-addressed by Merkle root hash. The AI grounds every answer in this data. | Riders can prove the AI reasoned over the **community's actual route data**, not a hidden dataset. |
| **0G Chain** | Records community route corrections in the `RouteCorrections` contract. | The knowledge base is **community-owned and auditable** — a living transit map of Lagos. |

The result: a transit knowledge base owned by the riders who use it, that gets
more accurate every time someone corrects a fare or a route.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites
- Node 18+
- A funded **0G Galileo testnet** wallet:
  1. Create a fresh EVM wallet (e.g. MetaMask) — use a throwaway, never a real-funds wallet.
  2. Get test tokens from the faucet: https://faucet.0g.ai
  3. Network: RPC `https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai`, Chain ID `16602`.

### Install
```bash
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # then add your PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Seed the route data onto 0G Storage
```bash
npm run seed
# prints a root hash → paste it into .env.local as ROUTES_ROOT_HASH
```

### Deploy the corrections contract to 0G Chain
```bash
npm run deploy:contract
# prints a contract address → paste it into .env.local as CORRECTIONS_CONTRACT
```

### Run
```bash
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Type or tap the mic and ask for a route in any supported language.

## Roadmap (post-group-stage)

- Voice replies via 0G Compute speech models (full hands-free for drivers).
- Upvote-weighted corrections so the most-trusted community data wins.
- Live crowding/traffic signals contributed by riders.
- Expand beyond Lagos to Abuja, Kano, Ibadan.

## Built with

[0G Compute](https://docs.0g.ai) · [0G Storage](https://docs.0g.ai) ·
[0G Chain](https://docs.0g.ai) · Next.js · ethers v6

_Route data and fares are community-maintained and approximate. Corrections welcome — that's the whole point._
